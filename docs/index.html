		<article><div><h1>Hey, I'm Faizan!</h1><p>Welcome to my weird little static site.  
This whole thing is built with my own Python SSG (static site generator).  
Youâ€™re looking at a page that was generated from markdown, using my own code.  
Check out my <a href="https://github.com/fyzanshaik">GitHub</a> if you want to see more of my stuff.</p><p>---</p><p>So what is this?  
Basically, I wrote a Python script that takes markdown files (like this one),  
turns them into HTML using a bunch of classes (nodes and stuff),  
and spits out a website.  
It copies over images and CSS too, so it looks half-decent.</p><p>---</p><p>How do you build it?  
Just run my <code>main.sh</code> or <code>build.sh</code> scripts.  
They clean up the old build, run the generator, and copy everything to the right place.  
Then you can serve it with Python or push it to GitHub Pages.</p><p>---</p><p>What did I learn?</p><ul><li> How to walk through folders and files in Python</li><li> How to use OOP to make a tree of nodes (like HTMLNode, ParentNode, LeafNode)</li><li> How to turn markdown into nodes, and then into HTML</li><li> How to deal with all the annoying little details (paths, links, images, etc)</li><li> That static site generators are actually pretty fun to make</li></ul><p>---</p><p>What are the limitations?</p><ul><li> No fancy code blocks (so no triple backticks, sorry)</li><li> Only basic markdown: headings, paragraphs, bold, italic, inline code, links, images, lists</li><li> No tables, no HTML passthrough, no nested lists, no escaping</li><li> If you mess up your markdown, it might just crash</li><li> The code is messy, but hey, it works</li></ul><p>---</p><p>Here's a picture of the architecture (fancy, right?):</p><p><img src="./images/1754138103189.png" alt="SSG Architecture Overview"></img></p><p>And here's how markdown gets turned into nodes and then into HTML:</p><p><img src="./images/1754335149146.png" alt="Markdown to Node Conversion"></img></p><p>---</p><p>Anyway, thanks for stopping by.  
If you want to make your own, fork my repo and go wild.  
It's all on <a href="https://github.com/fyzanshaik/pluto">GitHub</a>.</p><p>---</p><p>See ya!</p></div></article>
